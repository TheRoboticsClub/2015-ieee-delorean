be sure to have this installed:

ros-kinetic-rosbridge-server

and apache:

sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
(this also will run apache automatically. If you want to stop it then: sudo service apache2 stop


to run:

be sure to have your html file done

in the ros url on your html file be sure to have: 'ws://pi_address:9090' and place the html file in /var/www/html/index.html folder. This can be done by:

cd /var/www/html
ls -al
sudo chown <user>: index.html
and then modifiying the file or simply by making a cp


and then:

1-run roscore on your pi
2-run roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
3-go to http://pi_address on your web browser on the controller device. You should be in the same network as the car. Also, you should make sure
that the two machines can resolve machine names.


----OPTIONAL-----

If your controller device won't have internet connection, you can download the 2 necessary ros javascript files from a browser.
This 2 scripts are located at:

http://static.robotwebtools.org/EventEmitter2/current/eventemitter2.min.js

http://static.robotwebtools.org/roslibjs/current/roslib.min.js

you should format those 2 files for easier understanding of the code if you plan to read it.
