to start gps driver that publishes sensor_msgs/NavSatFix  do this:

rosrun nmea_navsat_driver nmea_serial_driver _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 _baud:=115200

------aditional information--------------------------------------------

    Baud Rate: 4800/9600/14400/19200/38400/57600/115200 bps (Bluetooth), 115200 (USB)
    Output Message: NMEA 0183 v3.01(Default: GGA, GSA, GSV, RMC)
    
in our case, our GPS has 115200 baud rate via USB connection on port /dev/ttyUSB0. Bluetooth connection
has several baud rates: 4800/9600/14400/19200/38400/57600/115200

    
 thatś why we use NMEA gps driver. gpsd_client can work too, but we had a problem trying to run the gpsd_client client.cpp node.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------

if you get port permission denied error, you must check this:

groups <your_username>

if your username does not appear in the list, then do this:

sudo gpasswd --add <your_username>
cd <your_node_directory>
chmod +x <your_node>

the, you should be able to launch the nmea driver. You can check if all is good with:

rostopic list <---------------this should show you several topics, but we are interested in /fix , /vel and /time_reference

to see sensor_msgs/NavSatFix messages on /fix topic, we can do:

rostopic echo /fix

and you should see the messages. 

(optional) If we want UTM-encoded position, we can run another node that takes NavSatFix messages and publishes nav_msgs/Odometry
messages

rosrun gps_common utm_odometry_node

now, to check Odometry messages, we can do:

rostopic echo /odom
